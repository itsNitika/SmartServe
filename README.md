SmartServe

SmartServe is a full-stack service management system that helps users request and manage services from a single platform.

The main idea behind this project is to make the service request process simple, organized, and easy to track. Users can browse available services, create requests, and check the current status of their requests.

The project also includes a backend system for handling users, services, authentication, and service requests.


1. What is SmartServe?

SmartServe provides a single platform where users can request services and track their requests.

Instead of depending on manual communication, the complete process can be handled through the application.

a) User Side :

Users can register, log in, view available services, create service requests, and track their request status.

b) Service Management :

Services can be added and managed through the system. Users can select the service they need and create a request.

c) Request Tracking :

After creating a request, users can check whether the request is pending, assigned, in progress, or completed.

Pending → Assigned → In Progress → Completed


2. Features :

a) User Authentication :

Users can create an account and log in securely. JWT is used to authenticate users and protect private routes.

b) Service Management :

Users can view the available services and select the service they want to request.

c) Service Requests :

Users can create a request for a particular service. The request is stored in the database and can be accessed later.

d) Request Tracking :

Users can track the current status of their service requests.

A request can move through stages such as:

Pending → Assigned → In Progress → Completed

e) Role-Based Access :

Different users can have different permissions. For example, a normal user can create and track requests, while an admin can manage users, services, and requests.

f) REST APIs :

The frontend communicates with the backend through REST APIs for authentication, services, requests, and other operations.


3. Tech Stack :

a) Frontend :

- React.js
- JavaScript
- HTML5
- CSS3

React.js is used to build the user interface and create reusable components.

b) Backend :

- Node.js
- Express.js
- REST APIs

Node.js and Express.js are used to handle API requests, authentication, business logic, and communication with the database.

c) Database :

- MongoDB

MongoDB is used to store users, services, service requests, and other application data.

d) Authentication :

- JWT (JSON Web Token)

JWT is used to authenticate users and protect private APIs.

e) Development Tools :

- Git
- GitHub
- Postman
- VS Code
- MongoDB


4. How SmartServe Works :

The basic flow of the application is:

User
  ↓
Register / Login
  ↓
View Available Services
  ↓
Select a Service
  ↓
Create Service Request
  ↓
Request Stored in Database
  ↓
Request Assigned / Processed
  ↓
Status Updated
  ↓
User Tracks Request


a) User Registration/Login :

The user first creates an account or logs into an existing account.

b) Service Selection :

After logging in, the user can view the available services and select the required service.

c) Request Creation :

The user submits the required details and creates a service request.

d) Request Processing :

The request is stored in MongoDB and can then be assigned and processed.

e) Status Tracking :

The status of the request is updated as the service progresses, allowing the user to track it.


5. Authentication :

SmartServe uses JWT-based authentication.

The basic authentication flow is:

User enters login details
        ↓
Frontend sends login request
        ↓
Backend verifies credentials
        ↓
JWT token is generated
        ↓
Token is sent to frontend
        ↓
Frontend sends token with protected requests
        ↓
Backend verifies token
        ↓
Request is allowed


a) Registration :

A new user provides their details and creates an account.

b) Login :

The backend verifies the user's credentials.

c) Token Generation :

After successful login, the server generates a JWT token.

d) Protected Routes :

The token is checked before allowing access to protected APIs.

a) Client :

The "client" folder contains the React frontend, including pages, components, and API-related code.

b) Server :

The "server" folder contains the Node.js and Express backend, including routes, controllers, models, and middleware.


7. API Overview :

Some of the main APIs are:

Method   Endpoint                    Description
POST     /api/auth/register         Register a new user
POST     /api/auth/login            Login user
GET      /api/services              Get available services
POST     /api/services              Add a new service
POST     /api/requests              Create a service request
GET      /api/requests              Get service requests
GET      /api/requests/:id          Get request details
PUT      /api/requests/:id          Update a request
DELETE   /api/requests/:id          Delete a request


8. Database Structure :

MongoDB is used to store the application data.

a) Users :

Stores information related to registered users.

b) Services :

Stores the services available on the platform.

c) Service Requests :

Stores the requests created by users.

A service request can contain information such as:

{
  "userId": "user_id",
  "serviceId": "service_id",
  "status": "Pending",
  "createdAt": "timestamp"
}


9. User Roles :

a) User :

A normal user can:

- Register and log in
- View available services
- Create service requests
- View their requests
- Track request status
- View request history

b) Service Provider :

A service provider can:

- View assigned requests
- Accept requests
- Update request status
- Manage assigned services
- Mark requests as completed

c) Admin :

An admin can manage the overall application.

Admin operations can include:

- Managing users
- Managing services
- Viewing requests
- Assigning requests
- Updating request information

11. Why I Built SmartServe :

I wanted to build something that was more than a basic CRUD application.

While working on SmartServe, I wanted to understand how a real-world application handles authentication, different user roles, service requests, APIs, and database operations together.

The project also helped me understand how the frontend and backend communicate with each other in a complete full-stack application.


12. Challenges Faced :

a) Authentication and Authorization :

Making sure that only authenticated users could access protected features was one of the important parts of the project.

I also had to make sure that users could only perform actions allowed by their role.

b) Frontend and Backend Integration :

Connecting the React frontend with the Express backend and handling API responses properly was another important part of the project.

c) Database Management :

Managing users, services, and service requests required a proper database structure so that the required information could be stored and retrieved easily.

d) Error Handling :

The application also needs to handle invalid requests, incorrect inputs, and server-side errors without breaking the user experience.


13. What I Learned :

While building SmartServe, I got practical experience with:

- Full-stack web development
- React.js
- Node.js and Express.js
- REST API development
- MongoDB
- JWT authentication
- Protected routes
- Role-based authorization
- Frontend-backend integration
- API testing using Postman
- Git and GitHub


14. Future Improvements :

Some features that can be added in the future are:

- Real-time notifications
- Email and SMS notifications
- Online payment integration
- Rating and review system
- Advanced admin dashboard
- Better analytics and reports
- Location-based service tracking
- AI-based service recommendations
- Mobile application
